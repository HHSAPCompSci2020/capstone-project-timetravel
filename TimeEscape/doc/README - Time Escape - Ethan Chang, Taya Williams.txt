Introduction: 
What does your program do?
* TimeEscape is a 2D platformer game that involves using time travel to solve various complicated puzzles. [a]
[b]
What problem does it solve? Why did you write it?
* entertainment
What is the story?
* the protagonist goes back in time to save their father/mother/friend who got killed by a person who time traveled
What are the rules? What is the goal?
* The goal of the game is to fully complete all the puzzles and save their “insert person”.
Who would want to use your program?
What are the primary features of your program?


Instructions:
Which keyboard keys will do what? 
* wasd to move in different directions[c]
Where will you need to click? 
Will you have menus that need to be navigated? What will they look like? 
* there will be a main menu for starting up the game 
   * a button to start the game
   * a button to quit the application
* there will be a pause menu when the game is paused
Do actions need to be taken in a certain order?


Must-have Features:
* Time travel[d]
   * using time travel to solve various puzzles (ex. moving a box in a current timeline to later go back in time and use that box)
* Physics
   * Every basic platformer game needs physics for the game to work, like gravity and collisions between objects so that the player can interact with the world.
* Timer/Clock
   * measure when a character in a previous timeline moves.
* Puzzles
   * To make the game engaging, we will have puzzles that specifically require the player to use time travel.
* GUI


Want-to-have Features:
* Coins/Easter Eggs
   * having hidden objects and side goals(ex: coins scattered around the puzzles; other objects hidden around levels)
* Enemies/Obstacles
   * objects that could affect the character and make it more difficult to complete a puzzle
* Art and sprites for the game
* A fully flushed out level with a puzzle.
* Other special abilities like power ups to make the puzzles more challenging.


Stretch Features:
*  Complete levels
   * It will probably take some time to complete the time travel aspect of the game and getting it to work, so creating multiple levels will take too much time. We will probably only make a test world and maybe a few levels.[e]
* Story is not essential to the purpose of the project and it’s a part of the level design, so this will also probably not be implemented.
* Music




Class List:
* Main class
* GUI classes
   * DrawingSurface
   * Main Menu
   * Pause Menu
* GameBoard
   * timeTravel() - creates a new Character w/ previous inputs
* Sprite classes
   * Character
   * Obstacle classes

[a]The concept seems very interesting, I would probably play something like this.
[b]Will the player choose how far back in time he/she goes, or is it a predetermined time. If the player can choose how far back they can go, can they meet themself?
[c]How will the character travel back in time? Is there going to be a button, or an item that the player has to get first
[d]Will the player be able to back and forth between times, or is it a one way trip
[e]It makes sense that you're only making a test world.
